# Afero Beetle Library
*Version 1.0.199*

**Beetle** is a daemon that provides the interface between the Linux “BlueZ” Bluetooth(tm) package and the Afero Hub Software.

The Afero Hub Software is functionally identical to the code included in Afero's mobile applications, and Beetle provides a standard interface for that code to use to communicate with the Linux Bluetooth(tm) stack in the same manner it communicates on other platforms.

It is released under The MIT License. See the accompanying LICENSE file for more details.
### Supported Devices

This software has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 and a Raspberry Pi Zero (with USB attached Wifi and BT adapters) and should work on any model and revision of Pi hardware. Please see the [Afero Developer Documentation][link1] for important information on supported Operating System limitations. Future releases of Beetle will provide support for other similar hardware architectures.
   
### Build and Installation
Build instructions for this software will be added in the near future.
